        <h3>Juicy 1/4 lbs burger patty on soft brioche bun with all the toppings you could want.</h3>
        <h3>Makes four burgers</h3>
        <p>
            This is a take on a classic pub-style burger. The burger is somewhat thick, depending on how you
            like your burger, it can be between medium well to well done. Medium well can be a bit too rare for some people, but 
            you will never have a juicer burger until you have a burger cooked to medium well.
