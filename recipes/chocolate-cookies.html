       <h3>Soft and chewy with plenty of chocolate chips, the cookies are so good that they 
        will not last a day before being devoured. <strong>Makes 2 dozen cookies</strong></h3>
       <p>
        This is a recipe that started  from the back of a Toll House chocolate chip bag, 
        but over the years I have tweaked this recipe to be something entirely my own. This 
        recipe uses two different types of flour to get the chew feel just right, it also includes
        coffee that elevates the chocolate flavors to another level.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
