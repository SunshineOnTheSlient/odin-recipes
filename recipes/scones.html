        <h3>Makes 8 scones</h3>
        <p>Nothing is quite the same as some homemade scones, top them with coated cream and 
            strawberry jam. Pair them with a lovely cup of tea with milk and surger and enjoy a snack that would
            make anyone from England proud.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>5 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup butter, cold</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 400 degree F and lightly grease a baking sheet</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking power, and salt into a large bowl; cut in butter 
                with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>TIP: freeze the butter for 10 minutes and then using a box grater, grate the butter into 
                    the flour mixture. Use two forks to cut the butter into the flour mix.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Whisk milk and egg in a small bowl, then gradually stir into flour mixture until moistened.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, 5 or 6 turns.</li>
            <li>Pat or roll dough out into a 1/2-inch thick round. Cut into 8 wedge-shaped pieces and place onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake scones in the oven for about 15 minutes or until golden brown on top.</li>
        </ol>
